9-19. Generating Files. Create a sister program to the previous problem. Create a binary
data file with random bytes, but one particular byte will appear in that file a set
number of times. Obtain the following three values:
    1.
    a byte value (0-255),
    2.
    the number of times that byte should appear in the data file, and
    3.
    the total number of bytes that make up the data file.
    Your job is to create that file, randomly scatter the requested byte across the file,
    ensure that there are no duplicates, the file contains exactly the number of
    occurrences that byte was requested for, and that the resulting data file is exactly the
    size requested.
