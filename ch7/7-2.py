# Dictionary Keys

'''
We know that dictionary values can be arbitrary Python objects, but
what about the keys? Try using different types of objects as the key other than
numbers or strings. What worked for you and what didn't? As for the failures, why do
you think they didn't succeed

print 'only hashable object could be the key of dict'
